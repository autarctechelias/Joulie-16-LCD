———————2.3.2———————
  · Configured systemd-network to be both DHCP Client and Server for use in existing networks and independent setups
  · ditched queue in favor of deque
    → allows for old entrys to fall off the queue instead of blocking when queue is full
    → Now all threads just peek at the latest value in the queue and no thread actually pop's from the queue
  · Added custom battery characters for the display
  · Added scaling factor for the current measurement. To use simply place a "currentscale.txt" into the SD-card's boot partition and put a scaling factor in the first line.
  · Started implementing multi-bms compatibility
  · Improved web-ui and added german language
